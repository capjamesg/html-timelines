Make a timeline with HTML.

## Inspiration

The IndieWeb wiki has a HTML timeline that documents the history of [IndieWeb events](https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps). The existing timeline was made by hand by [Tantek](https://tantek.com). This project is intended to make creating similar timelines easier.

## How to Use

First, clone this project and install the required dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/capjamesg/html-timelines/
cd html-timelines/
pip3 install jinja2
```

Then, create a new file called `data.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "row name": {
      "row item (i.e. a month or year)": {
        "url": "https://example.com..."
      },
      "color": "lightgreen"
  }
}
```

`color` is a required key in a row name. It is used to set the colour for the row. Valid HTML colours are accepted.

Here is an example that represents a year of blog posts in a category and includes links to each category page:

```json
{
    "IndieWeb": {
        "January": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/january/",
        },
        "February": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/february/",
        },
        "March": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/march/",
        },
        "April": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/april/",
        },
        "May": "",
        "June": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/june/",
        },
        "July": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/july/",
        },
        "August": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/august/",
        },
        "September": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/september/",
        },
        "October": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/october/",
        },
        "November": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/november/",
        },
        "December": {
            "url": "https://jamesg.blog/december/",
        },
        "color": "lightgreen"
    }
}
```

If you want to leave a value blank, set the value of a key to an empty string.

Then, run the script:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

A file called `table.html` will be created with the results of your table.

Here is an example of the result above rendered, with an additional row for effect:
